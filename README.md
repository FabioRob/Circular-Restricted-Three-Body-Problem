# Circular-Restricted-Three-Body-Problem
CR3BP implementation in Mathematica

In this Notebook i reproduce the algorithm which finds itinerary region in the planar circular restricted three body problem proposed in the book(2006) :
	Dynamical Systems, The Three-Body Problem, And Space Mission Design
		Wang Sang Koon
		Martin W. Lo
		Jerrold E.Marsden
		Shane D. Ross
		
The algorithm is described step by step in chapter 4 : "Construction of Trajectories with Prescribed Itineraries".
